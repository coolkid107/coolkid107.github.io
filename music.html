    <h1>About my Music</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>If you read the "Music production section" on the "About me page" of this website (I doubt you actually did)... But, if you did decide to read the entirety of my long, silly introduction, you would have observed that I briefly spoke about my background in music production. I say "briefly" because I don't think I went deep enough into the subject seeing that I am so passionate for music / music production! So, it is time for a deeper, more in-depth analysis of my music production journey. Ever since I was a kid, I have always had an interest in music. Who is behind it? How it works? and how I could create my own. The first interaction with music "that I can recall in it's entirty" was a sing along game on the Nintendo Wii-u that I was severly obssessed with when I was around 4 - 5. I remember spending hours singing along to "Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy! So heres my number, so call me maybe?" Ah, those were the days! Fast foward to around early 2015, one hot summer day my mother decided to lend me her Ipad while she was "probably" taking a phone call or something. But, anyway of course I did not possess my mothers Itunes login credentials (because why would an adult ever give such sensitive information to a ignorate child such as myself?) so I could not install any apps off of the Appstore. Left with no other options, I was forced to look at / play the pre-installed apps. One of those apps was "Garageband". Because Garageband possessed such a colorful / cool icon, It was only a matter of time before I discovered this awesome app and launched it! Having no idea what the app actually was, I proceeded to launch it... Instantly, after oppening it, I was met with some of the coolest features I have ever seen on any form of application! "The ability to play the piano, the guitar, the drums, and the bass... WOWZA!" 6 year old me probably thought. But, before I could start cooking some trash, "dumpster-fire beats" my mother returned from her "call". After that wonderfull interaction, each-and-everytime I got my hands on an Ipad, or any other form of Ios device for that matter I would instantlly go to Garageband. For years I never actually knew what I was doing in Garageband (probably due to my stupidity, as I was just a child whom could barely read chapter books)! I didn't even know what the "midi editor" was, or what a plug-in was... But, eventually I got older, and with that my intellectual abilities increased. It took me until the seventh grade to realize / figure out what the midi editor was, and what plug-ins were.. Through time, practice and overcoming multiple adversaries (that being mixing / mastering my songs) I would eventually start creating beats that were not so bad as the beats (if you could even call them that) that I created when I was young. After I fully mastered the art of beatmaking in Garageband my next goal was to remix a couple of my favorite songs! I started out by remaking Smile by Juice WRLD, then Lucid dreams by Juice WRLD, then Wishing by Juice WRLD, then Blinding Lights by the weekend, then Death bed by Powffu, then The Five Nights At Freddy's one song by the Living tombstone, then the FNAF four song by the living tombstone, then Carry on by Avenged SevenFold, among many others! Fast forward to the ninth grade, I was starting to get bored of using Garageband, I realized that its not the best DAW for creating high-quality, proffesional beats. I knew that there would need to be change if I wanted to continue possesing a passion for producing music. That is when I remembered "Hey! FL Studio exists!" That brings us too now. I've been using FL studio for around 2 years now give or take...</p>
