    <h1>About programming</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I have been programming for around 5 years now! I started with Scratch. Later, in around the ninth grade I was introduced to the world of Front end development. When I first started out creating websites, I had no idea what I was doing... I would search up videos of others creating websites in which I would then attempt to copy their websites changing a few, minuscule details such as the background color of the header, or adding a different logo to the header, just two examples. Then, eventually the school year came to an end, and I had more time on my hands. So, I decided to use that time wisely, I would use my school account to gain access to Codecademy in which I then proceeded to Learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript! After around two-to three months (give or take) of constant learning, and skill development I would start creating simple, minuscule websites (non responsive of course). After learning front end development, I decided that it was time to branch out, so I decided to learn Python for UI development. It took around a month to finish the Codecademy course. In which immediatly after I finished that course, I would create a simple VPN using Tkinter, and few other modules associated with Python development. Then, second semester of tenth grade (2024) I decided that I wanted move to backend development. So, using Codecademy I would learn PHP and SQL. After finishing that course I would create a simple login / registration system utilizing MySQL for the database. Fast foward to the end of tenth grade, I decided that I wanted to learn LUA for Roblox development! The codecademy course didn't provide enough information, to get me started with creating fully functional, Roblox games! So, I decided to do the next, good thing (the old fashion way) "Books!" So, I went on Amazon and purchased about "Lua development in Roblox studio". I am still in the midst of reading that book, taking notes, and obtaining knowledge! At this time, I can confidently say that I can program a basic game in Roblox! In the near future (after I finish mastering the art of Lua of course) I intend on moving on to learning C++ development so I can create my own game engine like Roblox Studio, Unity, and Unreal!</p>
