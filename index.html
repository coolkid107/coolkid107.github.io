    <h1>My Name!</h1>
    </center>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Howdy fellow internet user! Whether you stumbled upon this portfolio via my <b>Discord</b>, my <b>Replit</b>, or
      just by pure coincidence. Here is every little, minuscule detail you could need know about me. To start I go by
      the name <b>Astrylly</b> online <i>(not my legal name of course)</i>. Now you're probably wondering <i>"what does
        that silly name mean?"</i> Well... it means nothing... How I created this name was by placing small slips of
      paper with letters, and words into a toy claw machine.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div class="claw">
      <center>
        <br>
        <h3>Here is the picture of the claw machine in question</h3>
        <br>

        <h6>source "Kmart"</h6>
        <br>
      </center>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>I kept playing the claw machine until I won exactly <b>two words</b> and <b>three letters</b>. The ratio of
      letters to words was crazy. If I remember correctly, <b>25 of the slips</b> had letters, and <b>10 of the
        slips</b> had words. The words in question were all verbs and adverbs, no nouns were present in the mix, for
      originality (though it's up to you to decide if picking an online persona using a claw machine is what you
      consider to be quote <i>"original"</i>. But, anyway on my first attempt at the claw I won the letter 'y', on my
      second attempt I scored the letter 'l', on my third attempt I pulled the word 'as', on my fourth attempt another
      'l', and finally my fifth attempt, <li>Drum roll please!</li><br>'try'. Now that I had all my words and letter
      selected I pulled out my handy notebook and I started creating / writing down multiple different word combonations
      using the letters / words selected. I would create around <b>5</b> combonations using the letters and words before
      I pulled out a die. I then rolled the die to determine which combonation I would use to name my channel. I then
      placed the die in the palm of my hand, cupped my hands together, and then shook my hands. Growing up my father
      would always tell me that if you blow on the die after rolling it the odds of getting a lucky number would be
      higher, so I put my cupped hands up to my face and I blew! After running out of breath, I stood up and uncupped my
      hands, and the die fell. I immediatly got back on the ground and looked at the die '3'. I then glanced back at my
      notebook <b>column three: As - Try - L - L - Y</b>. I thought about that name for a few moments, and I then
      thought <i>"hey, I kinda like it".</i> After deciding that I liked lucks decision, I went and changed
      each-and-every social media accounts name I owned to <b>Astrylly</b>. So yeah, that is how I got my name! And,
      once again it is up to you to decide on whether or not my name is creative or not. XD</p>

    <p>Now with the unnecessarily lengthy name lore out of the way, I will tell my age... Boy, this should be a short
      section... <i>I hope....</i></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>I am 15</b> --- <i>August 31, 2008</i></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Welp, that was easy enough! At least I didn't have to introduce or create some crazy birthday lore, which goes
      deeper than the entirety of the Marvel Cinematic Universe XD</p>

    <h1>My Hobbies and Stuff</h1>
    </center>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Now, I'm not going to lie, I do not possess very many hobbies. But, somehow I am going to <i>unironically</i>
      find a way to make this section unnecessarily lengthy...</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first hobby I possess is, of course coding / programming</p>
    <br>
    <center>
    <h3 class="lang">languages I code / program in include:</h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><b class="list-b-1">HTML </b><i class="devicon-html5-plain"></i></li>
      <br>
      <li><b class="list-b-2">CSS </b><i class="devicon-css3-plain"></i></li>
      <br>
      <li><b class="list-b-3">JavaScript </b><i class="devicon-javascript-plain"></i></li>
      <br>
      <li><b class="list-b-4">Python </b><i class="devicon-python-plain"></i></li>
      <br>
      <li><b class="list-b-5">PHP </b><i class="devicon-php-plain"></i></li>
      <br>
      <li><b class="list-b-6">SQL </b><i class="devicon-sqldeveloper-plain"></i></li>
      <br>
      <li><b class="list-b-7">Lua </b><i class="devicon-lua-plain"></i></li>
    </ol>
    </center>
    <br>
    <p>And I am currently in the midst of learning C++ so, hopefully someday <i>"in the near future"</i> I can create my
      own game engine similar to popular ones such as: (Unity, Roblox, and Unreal).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Another Hobby I have is <b>Music production.</b> Ever since I was a tot I have possessed a passion for music. It
      started with some stupid sing-a-long game on the Nintendo Wii-U, and then it transpired into making garbage
      dumpster type beats on my mom's Ipad when I was like 6-or-7. Then I got my own Ipad, which led to me experimenting
      with Garageband even more then I did on my mothers device, now that I possessed the ability to access things like
      "Youtube", and install plug-ins. Eventually, through time and dedication I was able to fully master Garageband in
      which I started remaking / remixing my favorite songs such as: (The fnaf 1 song by the living tombstone, and
      Carry-on by avenged sevenfold). Finally, I've moved on to where I am today, the superior D-A-W for music
      production, FL Studio.<br> Nowadays I produce my own, original beats in which I've taken inspiration from the
      works of other producers including (Nick Mira, Metro Boomin, and Frozy).</p>
    <br>
    <p>Finally, I play a bit of video games. Not much, but some... On the offchance that I am playing a game, you can
      find me playing Roblox, Vr Chat, Rec Room, or Call of Duty Zombies. And yes, I am a Meta Quest 2 user for those
      wondering why I play so many Vr-based titles...</p>

  <!-- Extras -->

  <br>
  <br>
  <section class="extra">
    <h1>Extra</h1>
    <br>
    <p>I have Autism, ADHD, a rare genetic disored called russell silver syndrome (RSS for short), a form of dwarfism,
      dyslexia (that is probably the reason behind why my natural writing will often contain a ton of grammatical
      errors, and sometimes ("most of the time") I'll have trouble creating coherent scentences. Due to this, sometimes
      a single 20-page-essay can take upwards of a few weeks to complete / write!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>These factors are probably the reasoning behind why I possess no friends, and no social life (besides a few
      online interactions).</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>But yeah, feel free to explore the navigational links to see some of my other programming / coding projects,
      music projects, and much more! Enjoy, and have a fantastic day!</p>
    <p>Peace out dudes!</p>
